# Infinity Spa

Made a Spa website for one of my clients

**Link to project:** https://infinityspa.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 

The client wanted a modern website that fully displays the type of atmosphere and services they provide. Before starting I made a rough outline of how the design would look and which pages will show what information. I designed the site from a mobile-first perspective. For the HTML setup, I made each page exceptionally clear to understand, and for the CSS layout, I went with a more calm color theme to reflect the type of environment the client wanted to portray.


## Lessons Learned:

I was very surprised that I made this website very appealing and captured the vision of my client vision so well. Coding to bring your imaginations to life is hard but it's 10x harder when I have to create the vision of a next person point of view. I was happy to learn to always ask many questions no matter what and to take notes whenever I speak to a client about a project.
